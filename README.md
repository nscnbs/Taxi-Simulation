Project: Taxi Management System Simulation
Description: Developed a web-based taxi simulation system to emulate urban taxi operations and test algorithms for route optimization and process concurrency. Built with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Google Maps API, with potential for future expansion into a monitoring platform.
Technologies: TypeScript, React, Node.js, Google Maps API
Key Contributions:
•	Simulation Development: Developed the main system to imitate real-life taxi operations, allowing testing of route and optimization algorithms.
•	Flexible Design: Created a system structure that can easily add new features and grow into a control panel.
•	API Integration: Integrated external APIs, making it easy to add new functions in the future.
